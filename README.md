# `@bedard/warp-buttons`

When trying [Warp](https://warp.dev/), I noticed their home page has beautiful buttons. I am not affiliated with Warp in any way, this was just an experiment to learn how their stroke animation worked. If you find this repo interesting, you may also like my exploration of [Stripe's background gradient](https://github.com/scottbedard/gradient).
